Boismortier Sonata No. 6 (Opus 7) for three flutes, transcribed for three cellos

## Score and parts

In Lilypond, the idea is to have a single text file and generate PDF files
(score and parts) from it. However, when "developing" (entering notes) the
source file, one typically needs to repeatedly compile and display the PDF
to check that one is entering the notes correctly. If compilation generates a
score and parts, that means every time you compile, you get a number of PDFs,
but you're only interested in one of them. Therefore, it makes sense to develop
each part separately, and combine them into a single file only when they are
finished.
